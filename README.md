The user experience for this game is meant to me a fun one but also one that improves the mind. The first impression of this game is for people to find it fun and interesting to play. I would also like them to find it easy to use and navigate as it is aimed at a younger audience. I would like people to keep returning to the game so they can improve their memory as it can improve memory function with practice.

Design 
The design is a simple one so that it doesnt get to confusing for the user. The only colours i used were for the buttons. As well as black for the writing.

Technology
 HTML CSS and Javascript were used to create this game.
